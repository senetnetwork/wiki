## What is Rhino bird?
>"The rhino bird" is a bird species that coexists with rhinos in nature. It can help rhinos by pecking at the pests that attempt to suck their blood, and it can also predict the arrival of enemies."

It is a middleware for connecting games to the blockchain.
SENET proposes a solution called "Rhino Bird" to assist game developers or studios with excellent games to enter the web3.0 field faster、safer、easier, just like how the rhino bird helps rhinos in nature.

## Why need Rhino bird?

Generally speaking, the integration of existing games with blockchain brings a large development burden on the server side. It requires changing the existing server structure that uses DB to one that uses smart contracts to generate transactions in the blockchain. Many modifications are required due to large differences in processing methods and capacities, and it needs advanced expertise in blockchain technology. 

However, most of these burdens can be reduced by using adhesives. The game server can simply transmit the necessary data to the binder, which will use the smart contract to generate the necessary transactions and deliver the results to the client and server. In other words, the binder(plugin) takes over the role associated with the blockchain, so it is possible to transition to gaming dApps that utilize blockchain technology without extensive modifications to existing games.

We intend to use Rhino Bird to maximize SENET's adaptability to indie casual games. Rhino Bird, which receives data from clients, will use smart contracts to handle network-related work and provide server functions. This enables easy integration of indie casual games with the blockchain without the need to develop a separate server. With user playing, users will see various games they like in the SENET ecosystem.

Developers only need to implant a line of characters in the code of the mobile game application, and then repackage it, and users can download or launch this new installation package through our platform to achieve plugin implementation.
