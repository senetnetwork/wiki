## Positioning

SENET was inspired by the board game invented by the ancient Egyptians more than 5,000 years ago, which means "crossing". At first, SENET was just a game for entertainment, but it soon exerted significantly religious meanings. The ancient Egyptians believed that the movement of chess pieces from one end of the board to the other was like a soul traveling through the underworld to the afterlife. Today, the term SENET has a new meaning here: 

1. Discover the value of games. Since games are common to all civilizations, as old as the origin of humanity. 
2. Make games meaningful. merge it into daily life, as the ancient Egyptians did. 
3. Use games to connect more people and a bigger world, finally creat and remain traces of civilization in our era.
